# ACREW Savings

## Summary

Acrew will be a personal savings plan on-chain that would use social encouragement + shared accountability commitments to help enforce people to sticking to the savings plans they devise. If someone were to break their commitment, it would drop their accrued gains into other participant's locked funds, while still protecting their initial capital. Yield would be available by ensuring everyone included some liquid staked sol in their saving plan.

## MVP and Future Plans

For the first MVP, I will create one shared savings plan that will lock the funds for the given timescale, and any early unlocked funds will auto-distribute the additional yield to other locked participants.

Future extensions could include defi platforms as additional places to store locked funds, course learning attendance/commitments, and connections with fitness apps, etc., generically applied. Additionally, it will be beneficial to allow locked groups for people trying to save/be accountable together.

## Marketing

While not a terribly unique idea, I believe a clean implementation of it could do really well on Solana, and the technology easily supports the various features and future extensions I would like to build.

I believe creating tools that are "anti-degen" in some ways, but still fun and engaging will help balance some of the (incorrect) narratives about Solana.

I think the best way to begin to market this will be through early testing via NFT communities. For groups such as SMB, Saga Monkes, Galactic Geckos etc, I will buy one of their nfts, then offer it as a raffle to anyone that has that nft to participate in a shared plan. I plan to use feedback from those smaller and nft-gated tests to then buld out the formal public launch methods. I would appreciate much more advice on this strategy and how to make it effective!

## Technology and Testing

Tech stack is Solana, Anchor, Next.js, Vercel, and PostgresDB. There are a number of additional libraries as well for visuals and analytics, but those will be the main components.

I will write the tests in TypeScript and look forward to checking out Lava as part of the build.

## Design

The tool itself will be a phone-first webapp, with a modern greco-roman style design, classic off-whites and serif fonts with some small pixel elements to clearly tie it into web3. Everything will be built with first users in mind, with live loading tutorials upon first entry.
